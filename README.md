# Convex, an IRC library

 Convex is an IRC library that (tries) to be as idiomatic and intuitive as possible, without restricting customisability and overall control.

# Implementing the IPlugin interface

 Implementation of the IPlugin interface is fairly simple; use `Base.cs` as a guideline for this.

# Dependencies

 - .NET Core 3.0

 - Databasing: [Microsoft.Data.Sqlite](https://github.com/aspnet/Microsoft.Data.Sqlite)

 - Logging: [Serilog](https://serilog.net/)

 - Configurations: [SharpConfig](https://github.com/cemdervis/SharpConfig)

# Ending note

 For questions, or if I've missed anything, feel free to e-mail me at semiviral@gmail.com.

 I will be doing more comprehensive documentation at some point (likely upon first full release). It may be a while, as the code base currently changes often.
